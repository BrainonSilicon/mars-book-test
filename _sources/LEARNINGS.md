# Learnings

This file the here to capture the things that I learnt and explored during the project. In some projects it may take the form of a code graveyard, in others it may just be a jumble of notes to myself that I can reference later. 

### Creating Subsections
- the title of the section takes on the heading in the specific file and not the name of the file itself. 
  - therefore having clear naming conventions for files > heading
  - and also that the headings need to be short and focus on clarity

### Using Index and Glossaries 
- The only thing that is needed in your genindex.md file is an H1 title
  - e.g. # My Index
- To fix the index as first page issue I needed to name the index file as genindex.md
