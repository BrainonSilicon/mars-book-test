# About Mars Book Test
This repository is used to sandbox webistes built with jupyterbook for the puposes of user research, feature development, and for my own learning. The contents of this repo will be changed regularly based on the projects that I'm working on. Visit https://brainonsilicon.github.io/mars-book-test/ to view the current deployed site.

## Can I contribute or reuse the content of this repository?

Unlike many other open projects that I work on, the contents of this repository don't have a license attached. Currently I made the decision that the contents found here aren't avaliable for reuse because the features and projects experimented on within this repository may operate on different, and at times conflicting licenses. Specific project folders may indicate if the contents are avaliable under a license, however please recognize that it will extend to only the contents of that specific folder's contents. 

This does not mean that you can't contribute! 

If you see a typo, have a suggestion, or want to propose a fix - please open an Issue using one of the Issue templates. 

## How to use this repository. 

Specific projects have their own folder and will deploy to the same url. To change the project that is being deployed, please edit the  [`build-book.yml`](./.github/workflows/build-book.yml) file with the relevant folder's name.
