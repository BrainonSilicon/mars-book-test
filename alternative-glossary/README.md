# :books: Alternative Glossary

The Alternative Glossary is a different version of the [AIM RSF's Glossary of Terms](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Glossary-of-Terms) 
which can be viewed [here](https://aim-rsf.github.io/Glossary-of-Terms/). The Alternative Glossary has been developed in order to 
user test the layout of a Glossary and establish if a single long Glossary, or subsections of terms, are easier to use. </br>

For more information on the AIM RSF Glossary project please refer to the repository linked above. 

## :sparkles: How to Contribute

We know that the field of AI and Medicine is huge (and continually expanding) so we hope that the Glossary is able to be updated 
and maintained by a community of contribuors as well as being easy to use. 
The [Glossary's](https://aim-rsf.github.io/Glossary-of-Terms/) contents are being developed **openly** and invites contributions 
from **anyone**. If you would like to contribute a term to the Glossary, or edit one of the existing entries, please refer to the 
[AIM RSF's Glossary of Terms](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Glossary-of-Terms) repository, read the 
[Contributors Guidelines](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Glossary-of-Terms/blob/main/docs/contributing.md) and then join the Discussion 
on terms [here](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Glossary-of-Terms/discussions/3).
